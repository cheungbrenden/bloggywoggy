## Post #1 - Why start blog?

Why start blog? Good question. 

Because I watched a YouTube video and it told me to start one. Specifically, [this one](https://youtu.be/gGxe2mN3kAg).

During my hiatus from school, I have been doing a lot of self-studying. Sometimes it was quite productive and as a result, have been able to learn and practice skills that are useful and/or interesting. Other times, no information enters my brain as the monkey smashing his cymbals inside drowns it out. 

To reflect on the past is an important skill for growth and while I've been doing a great job at thinking about how I shouldn't have been playing video games on a video call with my girlfriend at the time, I haven't been doing much reflecting on the academia side of myself. And thus, this blog will (hopefully) be continuously updated with how my journey to learn is progressing. 

It'd also be a good place to put some goals down. These goals include:
- Finishing *How to Prove It* by Daniel J. Velleman
- Finishing the Fast.Ai course
- Creating at least ONE cool thing from Fast.Ai
- Fixing my sleeping schedule and having a decent morning routine

It'll be fun/depressing to see where I am in terms of these goals when I revisit this post in a month and reflect again in another post.
