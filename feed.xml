Why start blog? Good question. Because I watched a YouTube video and it told me to start one. Specifically, this one. During my hiatus from school, I have been doing a lot of self-studying. Sometimes it was quite productive and as a result, have been able to learn and practice skills that are useful and/or interesting. Other times, no information enters my brain as the monkey smashing his cymbals inside drowns it out. To reflect on the past is an important skill for growth and while I’ve been doing a great job at thinking about how I shouldn’t have been playing video games on a video call with my girlfriend at the time, I haven’t been doing much reflecting on the academia side of myself. And thus, this blog will (hopefully) be continuously updated with how my journey to learn is progressing. It’d also be a good place to put some goals down. These goals include: Finishing How to Prove It by Daniel J. Velleman Finishing the Fast.Ai course Creating at least ONE cool thing from Fast.Ai Fixing my sleeping schedule and having a decent morning routine It’ll be fun/depressing to see where I am in terms of these goals when I revisit this post in a month and reflect again in another post.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fastpages Notebook Blog Post</title><link href="https://cheungbrenden.github.io/bloggywoggy/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fastpages Notebook Blog Post" /><published>2020-02-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-02-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://cheungbrenden.github.io/bloggywoggy/jupyter/2020/02/20/test</id><author><name></name></author><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://cheungbrenden.github.io/bloggywoggy/images/chart-preview.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://cheungbrenden.github.io/bloggywoggy/images/chart-preview.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">An Example Markdown Post</title><link href="https://cheungbrenden.github.io/bloggywoggy/markdown/2020/01/14/test-markdown-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An Example Markdown Post" /><published>2020-01-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-01-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://cheungbrenden.github.io/bloggywoggy/markdown/2020/01/14/test-markdown-post</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html">Example Markdown Post</summary></entry></feed>
